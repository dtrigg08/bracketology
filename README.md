# Bracketology

This project uses d3.js and python to create a bracket.  The motivation was March Madness, but it can be used elsewhere.

## Installation

To run this project go to [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dtrigg08/bracketology/blob/master/bracketworks.ipynb]. 
OR
download the ipython notebook file.  Open a console/terminal from the location of the file.  Type ipython notebook. It should open up a browser with the code in it.
